Please retell the main idea of first part from Dead Poets Society orally.

The movie "Dead Poets Society" begins by describing the opening ceremony of Welton Preparatory Academy. It then shifts to the main characters (students) getting to know each other and some daily activities showing their life full of rules. Later, Keating appears. He is a funny, anti-traditional, and very charming teacher.

Keating's teaching method is not the traditional lecture, but encourages students to think independently, to discover themselves, and to try new things. He infects students with his passion and belief, letting them feel the power of life and the spirit of freedom from poetry. He often tells students: "Seize the day, kids, every moment in life is worth our cherish and experience."

When the students are first influenced by Keating and go to the cave to read poetry, they are taken away from the conventional reading method. They do not just read with their eyes, but feel the connotation of poetry and experience the emotions of poetry with their hearts. This ignites a fire in their hearts.
