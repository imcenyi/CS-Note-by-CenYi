To learn Mulan (Part I) and write down the transaltions of all Chinese idioms and four-word phrases.


稚嫩青葱 A young shoot all green
刀光剑影 the blade
一举一动 every motion
以免它露出锋芒 to silence its voice
灭顶之灾 the end og the kingdom
超乎想象 beyond imagining
跪地求饶 the imperial Army is on its knees
光宗耀祖 bring honor to us all
不发一言 be silent
